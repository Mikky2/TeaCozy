## General Information
We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. <br>
A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. <br>
These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. <br>
This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.<br>
